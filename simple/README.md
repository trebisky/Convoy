This is simple

It is my further hacked and trimmed version of ToyKeepers biscotti firmware for
the Convoy S2+ flashlight.

Note that both simple.c and simple_NOTES.c are here.

simple_NOTES has many more helpful comments

I began with a copy of "biscotti_ORIG" and started removing code that
was dead wood or deactivated clutter

The tk-*.h files were once shared among a bunch of different projects.
I have trimmed some of them.  "tk" no doubt stands for "ToyKeeper".
